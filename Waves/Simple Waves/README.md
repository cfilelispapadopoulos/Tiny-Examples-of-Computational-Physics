# Simple waves
Visualization of waves following the equation:

$$y(x,t)=Acos(kx-\omega t)$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wavenumber and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
The given codes are:
1) Simple visualization of a wave travelling towards the positive side of the $x$ axis.
2) Beating created by the sum of two waves travelling towards the positive side of the $x$ axis with the same amplitude and small difference in frequency $f$.
3) Standing wave created as the sum of waves travelling in opposite direction having the same amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$.
4) Inteference created by the sum of $N$ waves with small difference in frequency.
