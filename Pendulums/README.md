# Different (not so simle) pendulum cases

The three example files correspond to the following:
1) Not so simple pendulum (simple_pendulum.m): Solving the ODE with Kick-Drift-Kick method without small angle approximation.
2) Not so simple not so aerodynamic pendulum (simple_pendulum_drag.m): Solving the ODE, but this time aerodynamic drag is considered, with Kick-Drift-Kick method without small angle approximation.
3) The double pendulum (double_pendulum.m): The system of 4 ODEs is solved using explicit RK4 (ode45) for non-stiff differential equations.

 All provided codes are modular and can be executed with arbitrary initial conditions. Also, they output graphs related to the simulation and variables of interest for the simulated phenomena.
