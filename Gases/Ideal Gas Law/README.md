## 3D parallepiped with internal barier filled with $O_2$ in both compartments

The parallepiped is of height $h$, width $w$ and length $l$ (across x) and the barrier is located at position $p$ on $x$ axis. The code is modular for both compartments but the temperature should be prescribed in order to compute the pressure $P$ of each compartment at each step and from that the force on the barrier of known area $h w$.
